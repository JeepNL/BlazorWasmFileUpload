# Blazor Wasm File Upload

Upload Test repo for github issue: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30243

For this demo I'm only using 2 files, one on the client `FileUpload.Razor` and one on the server `UploadController.cs`. I think it's easier to see what's happening.

Fyi: FYI: I'm still learning C# / Blazor, so probably the code can be optimized... (it works on my PC ðŸ˜‰)
